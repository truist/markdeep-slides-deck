![In May of 2018, we bought this house and moved in.](img/Deck-001.png)

---

![It had this deck. It was ugly...](img/Deck-012.png)

---

![...but functional!](img/Deck-013.png)

---

![That September, we discovered a ton of wet, moldy insulation in the crawlspace. (This is the "after" picture.)](img/Deck-022.png)

---

![So we got all geared up and climbed in there to clean it out.](img/Deck-023.png)

---

![...and discovered a rotten foundation, in the back! (See the daylight, shining through?) üò°](img/Deck-024.png)

---

![After lots of agonizing over the options, we realized we had no choice but to tear off the deck üò¢](img/Deck-031.png)

---

![So we did...](img/Deck-032.png)

---

![...and yep, the foundation was awful. (You can see the drywall from the inside wall, there in one spot!) üò°](img/Deck-033.png)

---

![We found a broken concrete patio under it (that should have been removed!) and broke off the edges so we could see what we'd won!](img/Deck-034.png)

---

![Yep, more damage!](img/Deck-035.png)

---

At that point, we stalled. üò´ We covered up the foundation with house wrap, and left it for the winter.

(And had a very nice regular life, for a while.)

(Climbing in and out of our back door via a tall step stool.)

---

Jump ahead to spring 2019: we hired a crew to jack up the back of the house and replace the foundation. Fun!

Then in summer we were back at the deck.

---

![Here's the setup: concrete on the left (mostly gone in this picture), huge step into the garage, then up a ramp into a dump trailer, on the right.](img/Deck-042.png)

---

![A few thousand pounds of concrete later...](img/Deck-043.png)

---

![...and we had a grade-able surface! (And some super-old, super-fine, super-hard concrete that we gave up trying to remove.)](img/Deck-044.png)

---

![So we put up multiple layers of flashing! (House wrap, aluminum, z-flashing, flashing tape.)](img/Deck-045.png)

---

Then we got the house painted! (Not shown here.) The painters put up a bunch of new cedar shake, overlapping all that flashing, and replaced all the cracked shake.

---

![Then we installed some "temporary" stairs, so we didn't have to keep using a wobbly step stool.](img/Deck-047.png)

---

Then, winter again.

(We did a TON of interior electrical work. And replaced the attic windows.)

---

Spring / summer / fall 2020:

* COVID!
* We built an 8x4 raised bed!
* We tore out our furnace and all basement ductwork (ourselves)! (And had professionals install the new one.)
* We cleaned out the garage, did a bunch of wiring and lighting, spray-foamed the walls (and parts of the basement crawl spaces), and made clean walls / shelves / storage!
* We put up new ledger boards for the deck! (No pictures of the work, though.)
* We bought deck furniture at a great price, knowing we were going to build a deck the next summer!

(And, you know, regular life.)

---

Winter 20 / 21:

* Still COVID!
* We had a tree removed and put a fire pit in its place!
* We did a bunch more electrical work!
* I built a shop air cleaner out of the old furnace blower and used it while I scraped all the efflorescence off the basement walls!
* We used four bottle jacks, six posts, 2 6x6's, and 4 4x4's to replace the rotting support columns and jack the whole house about 3/4" (over the course of 8 weeks)!
    * And cracked the plaster / drywall all over the place - but the windows and doors are all fine!

(And, you know, regular life.)

---

April 2021:

* Owner/CEO of my really-great-company sells it out from under all of us; new owners are evil.
	* Oh no - what if we have to move? The house has no deck!
* I find a job with a new really-great-company where I won't have to move (üéâ) and I'll have two weeks off between jobs!
	* And I'm not going another year without a deck, dammit!

---

![...so in April we started making deck designs...](img/Deck-051.png)

---

![...and hand-drew a plan...](img/Deck-052.png)

---

![...and an east elevation...](img/Deck-053.png)

---

![...and a west elevation...](img/Deck-054.png)

---

![...and gave away the old joists we'd been storing because they weren't long enough, and they were full of nails...](img/Deck-061.png)

---

![...and here's what it looked like when I began laying out post locations (in early May).](img/Deck-063.png)

---

![Then it was time to start digging post holes!](img/Deck-071.png)

---

![Seven of them, each 42" deep! (Oh man, 42" is a DEEP hole.)](img/Deck-072.png)

---

![At 9:30pm, in 40-degree, rainy weather, because the concrete guys were coming the next morning!](img/Deck-073.png)

---

![I got the tubes in the ground with, like, 3 minutes to spare! (See the ramp they were setting up for their wheelbarrows?)](img/Deck-074.png)

---

![And they were filled! (And our horrible garage floor and back walk replaced, too!)](img/Deck-075.png)

---

![Two days later, it snowed - so this was just in time!](img/Deck-076.png)

---

Now, it's important to know that I ordered all the materials about 6 weeks before I was supposed to have that two weeks off between jobs.

And the materials had all arrived at Menards about two weeks before that time between jobs.

But they couldn't deliver them to me until *the week I started the new job*.

(And you can't pick up ~10,000lbs of material with your SUV.)

So what was meant to be a two-week, full-time job, turned into an all-summer, weekends-and-nights job.

---

![But the wood did eventually arrive! (And they blocked the whole street while they unloaded it.)](img/Deck-081.png)

---

![The truck driver was amazing, but this was the only way he could deposit it - blocking the driveway.](img/Deck-083.png)

---

![So we enlisted some help...](img/Deck-084.png)

---

![...and moved it all to the back of the driveway, and into the garage. (With the nice new floor!)](img/Deck-085.png)

---

![So finally in late May it was time to start preparing the space. (And you can see those ledger boards, in this picture.)](img/Deck-091.png)

---

![Cut, install, and notch the posts.](img/Deck-092.png)

---

![Laminate and attach the beams.](img/Deck-093.png)

---

![Already at this point, the kids were asking how long this would take üòâ](img/Deck-095.png)

---

Note that while I was laying out the post locations, I learned that the two back walls of the house weren't co-planar üò†. So if I made the deck (and the decking) parallel to one of the walls, it would be off by about 1.5" by the time I got to the other end of the deck.

So my original plan of just running the decking boards straight across the deck was going to highlight / emphasize that problem.

So we decided to switch to diagonal decking, which requires a lot more wood, a lot more planning, and a lot more work.

And we decided to "picture-frame" the decking, to help hide the discrepancy and make it look nicer.

---

(Because we're masochists, apparently.)

---

![So I broke out Minecraft to model how the picture framing would come together, of course!](img/Deck-097.png)

---

![Once we had that sorted out, it was time to put up joists!](img/Deck-101.png)

---

![It was a whole-family affair ü•∞ (Whole family not pictured.)](img/Deck-102.png)

---

![By mid-June the joists were all in, as were the railing posts.](img/Deck-103.png)

---

![It might be hard to notice from this angle, but we also added a TON of "blocking" between the joists, to support the picture-framing.](img/Deck-104.png)

---

![Then we chocolate-dipped the joists! (Or tediously applied flashing tape to all of them, so they'll last MUCH longer - you decide which!)](img/Deck-111.png)

---

![Next up is the stairs! It starts with a 12" trench for the concrete.](img/Deck-121.png)

---

![Then hand-cut stringers (6 of them!)](img/Deck-122.png)

---

![Then **lots** of fussy work to get everything installed level, straight, solid, and protected.](img/Deck-124.png)

---

![Then the first decking and lighting went in!](img/Deck-125.png)

---

![The first "real" decking started on August 1st.](img/Deck-131.png)

---

![And what a relief it was to actually be able to walk on (part of) the deck!](img/Deck-132.png)

---

![Remember how diagonal decking requires more, and longer, wood?](img/Deck-133.png)

---

![Three weeks later, it's all in!](img/Deck-134.png)

---

(Then a one-weekend break to paint my mom's great room, which was our Christmas present to her from two Christmases prior, but COVID üôÅ)

---

![Then we start on the railings.](img/Deck-141.png)

---

![And the other side, and the stairs!](img/Deck-143.png)

---

![Then the wiring for the lights, starting with the stairs.](img/Deck-151.png)

---

![And the railings.](img/Deck-153.png)

---

![Then the picture framing (it's now September). It was a one-piece-at-a-time puzzle, to make it all fit just right.](img/Deck-161.png)

---

![Here you can get a sense of how it goes in. (That green is pressure-treating copper chemical we applied to every cut.)](img/Deck-162.png)

---

![But oh how nice it looks, once it's done!](img/Deck-163.png)

---

![The decking was all done by mid October!](img/Deck-165.png)

---

![Then it was time to start ripping 1x8's down to 1x2.5's, for the privacy wall.](img/Deck-171.png)

---

![Measure twice, cut once! We put up some test pieces, and didn't like them; they were too thick.](img/Deck-172.png)

---

![So we ripped them down to 1.75". (Thereby wasting a lot of wood, and had to buy more.)](img/Deck-173.png)

---

![There, that looks nice!](img/Deck-174.png)

---

![Just the wall took 5 weeks in total, mostly because of bad weather.](img/Deck-175.png)

---

![(It's a two-sided wall.)](img/Deck-176.png)

---

![All that was left were fiddly bits like this carefully-notched board...](img/Deck-181.png)

---

![...that goes into this oddball little spot üíØ (And another on the other side of the stairs.)](img/Deck-182.png)

---

![And an ADA railing, because sometimes people need them.](img/Deck-191.png)

---

![And a plaque so we can always be remembered for our work üòÅ](img/Deck-201.png)

---

![And we can finally put out the furniture!](img/Deck-202.png)

---

![üéâüéâüéâ And our long, dark, deck-building saga was over! üéâüéâüéâ](img/Deck-210.png)

---

![That weekend in November actually had nice weather, so I got to sit on my new deck and just savor it, for hours...](img/Deck-211.png)

---

![...long enough, at least, to see the lighting turn on üòÅ](img/Deck-212.png)

---

![And just in time! A week later it snowed.](img/Deck-213.png)

---

![Let's go back and remember how the original deck looked...](img/Deck-221.png)

---

![...and compare it to what we have now üòÅ](img/Deck-222.png)

---

![The End](img/Deck-231.png)
